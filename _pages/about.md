I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), advised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), advised by Prof.Zhen-gang Lu and Prof. Zhengjun Liu.

I am interested in computational imaging techniques, with a focus on quantitative phase imaging in microscopy areas. My work integrates both software and hardware parts, realizing optical system performance improvement by algorithm design. I am actively looking for research internships.
