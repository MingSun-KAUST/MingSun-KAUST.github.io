I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), advised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), advised by  Prof. [Zhengjun Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhengjun-Liu-3) and Prof. [Zhen-gang Lu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/luzhengang).

My research interests lie in computational imaging techniques, with a particular focus on quantitative phase imaging in microscopy. My work bridges the gap between software and hardware, aiming to enhance optical system performance through innovative algorithm design.

I am actively seeking research internship opportunities. Feel free to contact me!
